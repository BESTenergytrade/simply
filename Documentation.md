## Scenario
Imaginable reality or future with respect to parameters beyond our control. E.g.
- Prosumer composition)
  - power demand
  - energy demand
- Flexibilities
- Policy regarding Network charges
- Policy regarding change of supplier 
- Digitalisation
- Grid expansion

## Variants
Changing components of the BEST energy trading system. E.g. regarding: 
 - Market mechanism
 - Network charges model 
 - Conditions for the commercial energy supplier
   
## Setups 
A setup is the quantity of the selected parameters of a simulation (e.g. network topology, prosumer composition, market mechanism, network charges).
Setups generate a model of the scenario variant under consideration from the simulation framework.
A Setup consists of a parameter set and a data set.
### parameter set
Includes all parameters that define decisions about the scenario variant
### data set
Includes all time series and other data files that are used in the model
